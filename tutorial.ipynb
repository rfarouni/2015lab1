    "The first thing to understand about git is that the contents of your project are stored in several different states and forms at any given time.\n",

    "You can think about git operating on four different areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Git Commands](git_layout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The **working directory** is what you're currently looking at. When you use an editor to modify a file, the changes are made to the working directory.\n",
    " - The **staging area** is a place to collect a set of changes made to your project. If you have changed three files to fix a bug, you will add all three to the staging area so that you can remember the changes as one historical entity. It is also called the **index**. You move files from the working directory to the index using the command `git add`.\n",
    " - The **local repository** is the place where git stores everything you've ever done to your project. Even when you delete a file, a copy is stored in the repo (this is necessary for always being able to undo any change). It's important to note that a local repository doesn't look much at all like your project files or directories. Git has its own way of storing all the information, and if you're curious what it looks like, look in the `.git` directory in the working directory of your project. Files are moved from the index to the local repository via the command `git commit`.\n",
    " - When working in a team, every member will be working on their own local repository. An **upstream repository** allows everyone to agree on a single version of history. If two people have made changes on their local repositories, they will combine those changes in the upstream repository. In our case this upstream repository is hosted by github. This upstream repository is also called a **remote** in git parlance. The standard github remote is called the **origin**: it is the repository which is given a web page on github. One usually moves code from local to remote repositories using `git push`, and in the other direction using `git fetch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of most git operations as moving code or metadata from one of these areas to another."

On your respective machines, you both add and commit your different changes, and your collaborator pushes theirs to the upstream repository. When you run `fetch`, git adds a record of their changes to your local repository *alongside* your own. These are called *branches*, and they represent different, coexisting versions of your project. The `fetch` command adds your collaborator's branch to your local repository, but keeps yours as well."

    "Having multiple branches is fine, but at some point, you'll want to combine the changes that you've made with those made by others. This is called merging.\n",

    "1. The two branches are different but the changes are in unrelated places; \n",
    "2. The two branches are different and the changes are in the same locations in the same files.\n",

    "The first scenario is easy. Git will simply apply both sets of changes to the appropriate places and put the resulting files into the staging area for you. Then you can commit the changes and push them back to the upstream repository. Your collaborator does the same, and everyone sees everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second scenario is more complicated. Let's say the two changes set some variable to different values. Git can't know which is the correct value. One solution would be to simply use the more recent change, but this very easily leads to self-inconsistent programs. A more conservative solution, and the one git uses, is to simply leave the decision to the user. When git detects a conflict that it cannot resolve, `merge` fails, and git places a modified version of the offending file in your project directory. **This is important:** the file that git puts into your directory is not actually *either* of the originals. It is a new file that has special markings around the locations that conflicted. We shall not consider this case in this lab, deferring it to a time just before you work with other collaborators on your projects.\n"
